mandom
======

A program to view random UNIX man pages.

Why?

To get a better idea of what tools are available, and what they do.



To install:

Currently the install script assumes you want to create a new subdirectory to your home directory called .bin. The script will be copied there, made executable, and the directory will be added to the path.

Run the install.sh script

sh install.sh
